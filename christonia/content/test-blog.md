## Introduction

The New Testament is one of the most scrutinized texts in human history. To understand its reliability, we must look at the manuscript tradition.

## The Argument from Antiquity

The time gap between the original compositions and our earliest surviving copies is remarkably short compared to other ancient works like Homer's Iliad.

> "The number of manuscripts of the New Testament... is so large that it is practically certain that the true text of every doubtful passage is preserved."

## Manuscript Evidence

With over 5,800 Greek manuscripts, the New Testament has a wealth of evidence that allows scholars to reconstruct the original text with high confidence.

## Internal Consistency

Despite being written by multiple authors over several decades, the core message remains strikingly unified.
